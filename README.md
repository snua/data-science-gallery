# data-science-gallery
A gallery for some of my personal work in data science:
 1. BP Energy Outlook: A quick demonstration to data wrangling with Pandas.
 1. Convolutional Neural Network: A demonstration of setting up a pipeline for image recognition projects using Keras+TensorFlow.
 1. Dimensionality Reduction using t-SNE: A quick overview of the powerful t-SNE.
